"""Energy consumption module of the iucm package

This module, together with the `dist_numerator` package contains the necessary
functions for computing the energy consumption of a city. The main API function
is the :func:`energy_consumption` function. Note that the :data:`OWN` value is
set to the value for Stuttgart, Germany. You should change it if you want to
model another city. The parameters of this module come from [LeNechet2012]_.
