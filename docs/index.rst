IUCM - The Integrated Urban Complexity Model
============================================

This model simulates urban growth and transformation with the objective of
minimising the energy required for transportation. This user manual
describes its technical implementation as the ``iucm`` python package.

Here we provide the principal steps on how to :ref:`install <install>` and
:ref:`use <getting_started>` the model, as well as a complete documentation of
the :ref:`python API <iucm-api-reference>` and the
:ref:`command line interface <Command.Line.API.Reference>`.

The scientific background will be published in a separate journal article.
